# Loan-Default-Prediction---ICL
A project based on the Imperial College of London's Loan Default Dataset. The project explores the different types of feature correlation and measures how well certain models would work. This was done for the DSCI 303 course at Rice University.

The use of machine learning in asset management is a part of data science that is slowly gaining traction in banks and start-ups. However, traditional methods can only predict the probability of a loan being defaulted on or not. Therefore, a more convenient method for determining the total loss involved in default is necessary. In this project, we propose a way of determining the percentage of loss if a loan is granted to an applicant. The data is taken from a 2013 competition by Imperial College of London[1]. The features are anonymized to a degree that the problem may only be solved using pure machine learning techniques. In this project, we primarily carry out algorithm comparisons to evaluate the reliability of our method. The experiment results show that mixed models which iteratively treat the problem as a classification and a regression problem have the least loss at 0.9 mean absolute error while keeping the recall and precision high. However, when compared to the leaderboard for the competition, our model was not competitive.
